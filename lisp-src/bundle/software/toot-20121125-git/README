Toot is a stripped down and, hopefully, simplified version of Edi
Weitz's Hunchentoot. It does not aim to be backwards compatible with
anything and large swaths of Hunchentoot functionality have been cut
out. Some of them may be put back someday. Use at your own risk. If it
breaks you get to keep both pieces, etc. etc.
