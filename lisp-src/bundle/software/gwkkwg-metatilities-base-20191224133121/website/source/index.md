### What it is

[Metatilities-base][] is the core of [Metatilities][]. It
has the good stuff that sits at the foundation of the rest of
the code that metabang.com writes.

[Metatilities][] is [metabang.com][]'s big box of stuff that
has accumulated over the years. It's full of things you're 
pretty sure you don't need but can't quite bear to part with. 

Putting metatilities-base into it's own project is a way of
doing a bit of spring cleaning while there's still time
(Summer is only three weeks away!)
