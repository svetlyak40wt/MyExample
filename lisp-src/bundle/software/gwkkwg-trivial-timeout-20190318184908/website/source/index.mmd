### What it is

Sometimes you don't have the time to wait.

Although most Lisps have a mechanism to write code that says
"do _this_ for 5 seconds and give up if you're not done",
they didn't agree on exactly what that mechanism should look
like. Trivial-timeout steps into the gap with a platform
independent syntax for timeouts. You use it like this:

    (with-timeout (duration)
      (run-some-long-running-code))

If `duration` (a time in seconds) is exceeded, then a
`timeout-error` will be signaled. A more idiomatic example
would probably be:

    (handler-case
      (with-timeout (60)
        (make-microwave-popcorn))
      (timeout-error (c)
        (declare (ignore c))
        (print "I wanted to make popcorn, but who has the time these days")))

Here's the full skinny:

### What is happening

5 Jan 2013 - Just cleanup, nothing exciting happening here.

10 Sept 2008 - Separated trivial-timeout from [lift][] and
[trivial-shell][]. There was much rejoicing.
